# why in the world did i make a whole room full of random stuff
to be frank, i made this for the hell of it. literally no particular reason, just felt like fun. a lot of my teachers recently have made little mini offices using google slides and i decided "yknow what, that sounds like a cool idea, i wanna make one" and so i did. this took like 2 days of work lol
